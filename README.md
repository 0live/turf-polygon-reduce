# turf-polygon-reduce

Gets the [Pole of Inaccessibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_inaccessibility) of the input polygon. This is the same as reducing that polygon to a point through a constant-speed shrinking.

The resulting point is the optimal "center" to place the polygon label to avoid collisions.
